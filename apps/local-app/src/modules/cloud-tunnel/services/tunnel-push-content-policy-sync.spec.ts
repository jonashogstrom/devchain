/**
 * Bridge B2 drift guard: the forwarder's push content policy
 * (`CONTENT_BEARING_PUSH_EVENTS`) must stay in lock-step with each active
 * broadcast-registry entry's `contentBearing` flag. A forwarded event without a
 * registry projection is inert because the forwarder has nothing to project.
 *
 * Layer: unit (contract sync). Same allowlist-in-two-places pattern as
 * `broadcast-allowlist-sync.spec` (registry ↔ shared push topic allowlist) and
 * `push-allowlist-sync.spec` (bridge ↔ shared): the policy is declared in two places
 * and this test fails LOUDLY on any drift.
 *
 * The invariant it protects (development-standards §three-lanes; mobile-chat-realtime
 * §hint-vs-catch-up): a forwarded event whose registry projection carries REAL CONTENT
 * must be in `CONTENT_BEARING_PUSH_EVENTS`, so the forwarder WITHHOLDS it on a plaintext
 * push to a non-E2EE-capable peer. If a content-bearing registry entry were added (or its
 * projection grew content) without the forwarder policy being updated, real content would
 * silently ship in plaintext — this test turns that red.
 *
 * Scope: ONLY the tunnel-forwarded events. Web-only registry entries (epic/review/…) also
 * carry content but never ride the push lane, so they are intentionally out of scope here.
