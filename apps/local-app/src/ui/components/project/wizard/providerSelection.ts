 * Family-coverage gate for wizard Step 1 (provider selection). Returns the family slugs that LOSE
 * coverage under the current selection — families that have at least one locally-available provider
 * (per the setup-preview's `familyAlternatives[].availableProviders`) but none of them is selected.
 *
 * The UI MUST NOT reimplement `computeFamilyAlternatives`; this is a pure set-intersection over the
 * server-provided alternatives (the single derivation lives on the backend, surfaced via setup-preview).
 *
 * Families with NO available providers (`availableProviders.length === 0`, i.e. `hasAlternatives ===
 * false`) are intentionally NOT returned: they cannot be covered by any selection and represent a
 * pre-existing template condition handled by provider substitution server-side, not a Step-1
 * violation the user can resolve here.
 *
 * Provider-name matching is case-insensitive — names are lowercased canonical on both sides, but we
 * normalize defensively so mixed-case selections (e.g. 'CLAUDE') still match.

 *
 * For every family whose template DEFAULT provider is not in the selection (unavailable or
 * deselected) but which HAS a selected available alternative, we map the family slug to the first
 * such alternative (in `availableProviders` order). Families already covered by their default need no
 * mapping; families with no selected alternative are left unmapped (the coverage gate blocks Next for
 * those that have alternatives, and families with none are a pre-existing server-substituted case).
